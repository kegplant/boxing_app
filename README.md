Boxing App
=====================================

The Boxing App is an iOS app written in Swift 4. 


Motivation
----------

iOS devices have good accelerometers and we decided to make an app where you can use them to fight an virtual opponent, with real punches.



Usage
-----


Tap [_Fight_](https://youtu.be/ogL3vPFV3T8) to start a fight. Hold your iOS device in your right hand and proceed to box with your virtual opponent. Your iOS device will vibrate when you finish a punch to simulate hitting your opponent. The app can reliably recognize right-handed punches, hooks, and uppercuts. Damage is calculated based on the type and speed of your punches. The display will notify you when your opponent's health is low.
